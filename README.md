# Mobile Coding Challenge

The movie database is an online service similar to IMDB where you can find a list of movies with their
description, images, trailers and so on. It has quite an interesting [API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to request data.

## Requirements:

Tapping on a movie, should open a simple details page. Details page should contain (Poster, Title,
Description and Rating)
